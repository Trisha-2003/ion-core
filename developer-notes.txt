## Notes to developers:

August 1, 2023

* Each ion-core version is designed to work with the corresponding ION release, e.g., ion-core 4.1.2 is designed to work with ION release 4.1.2.

* Main line of code is called "current." Each release will be tagged on current by the release number <x.y.z>.

* The open-source ion-core repo is maintained in a separate, private repo. The nasa-jpl/ion-core repo is a mirror. You may submit changes and it will reviewed by ION development team for inclusion into the baseline. If incorporated, your changes will be mirrored back out on the next official release.

* Development and testing should be done in separate branches called "update-x.y.z-<contributor-name-and-description>" where x.y.z is the "next" ION release. If the latest release is 4.1.2, the next release is either 4.1.3 or 4.2. If you are not sure which version it will be, just make a guess.

* Prior to release, all branches will be merged into a "integration-x.y.z" branch for testing. 

* Once integration and testing is complete, we merge integration-x.y.z back to current and tag that release point as "x.y.z" 

* If you are using ion-core for a specific project/mission, then you will fork a copy of ion-core (at whatever tag that is appropriate) and host that in your own repo. This repo is meant for open-source version of ion-core. If you have general improvement suggestion, please place your update in a separate update branch and it will be reviewed.
